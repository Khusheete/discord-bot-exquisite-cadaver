This is the list of possible commands:

```help```
 - Shows this help message

```create <game_mode> [character_limit] [word_count]```
 - Creates a game
 - *game_mode* can be either:
   - "whole_sentence" the participents will see the last sentence entirely
   - "first_words" the participents will see the first *word_count* words of the previous sentence
   - "last_words" the participents will see the last *word_count* words of the previous sentence
   - "random_words" *word_count* consecutive words are selected at random to be shown to the next participent
 - *character_limit* is the maximum number of characters one can post as a sentence for this game (default = 120)
 - *word_count* the number of words one will be able to see (if *game_mode* is not "whole_sentence") (default = 3)

```join <game_id>```
 - Makes you join the game *game_id*

```start <game_id>```
 - Start the game *game_id* if you are the owner of this game

```post <game_id> <sentence>```
 - This command should be sent as a direct message, if you are the next player to play, adds the *sentence* to the game. You will be notified when it is your turn to write. A sentence may not take multiple lines, any line break will be ignored.
 - Example: post 1234 Hello World.
 - This would add "*Hello World.*" to the game 1234.

```end|stop <game_id>```
 - Ends a game. If the game was not started, destroy it, and if it was, messages back the complete tale created during this game.

Where <*arg*> denotes a mandatory argument and [*arg*] an optional argument. All commands must be preceded by "ExquisiteCadaver" or "!ec", except when writing a direct message.
